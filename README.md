What is a heart attack?
A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked or cut off. Chest pain is the most common warning sign of a heart attack.
Definition: A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when there is a blockage in the blood flow to the heart muscle.
Cause: It is typically caused by a blood clot that forms in a coronary artery, which supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart.
Symptoms: Common symptoms include chest pain or discomfort (tightness, pressure, squeezing), shortness of breath, pain or discomfort in the arms, back, ##### neck, jaw, or stomach, lightheadedness, nausea, and cold sweats.
Risk Factors: Factors such as age, family history, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, and excessive stress increase the risk.
Emergency Response: Recognizing symptoms and seeking immediate medical help is crucial during a heart attack.
Diagnosis: Diagnostic tests include an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), blood tests for cardiac enzymes, and imaging tests like an echocardiogram or coronary angiography.
Treatment: Prompt treatment aims to restore blood flow and may include medications, oxygen therapy, angioplasty, stenting, or coronary artery bypass surgery.
Recovery and Rehabilitation: A comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program is often recommended post-heart attack.
Prevention: Maintaining heart health through lifestyle modifications, healthy diet, exercise, avoiding smoking, and managing stress is essential.
How does a heart attack occur?
Blockage Formation: A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when there is a blockage in the blood flow to the heart muscle.
Coronary Arteries: The blockage usually forms in one or more of the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart.
Plaque Buildup: The most common cause of blockage is the gradual buildup of fatty deposits called plaque on the inner walls of the arteries. This process is known as atherosclerosis.
Blood Clot Formation: Sometimes, the plaque becomes unstable and ruptures, leading to the formation of a blood clot at the site of the rupture.
Complete or Partial Blockage: The blood clot can partially or completely block the coronary artery, obstructing the blood flow to the heart muscle.
Lack of Oxygen: When the blood flow is restricted or blocked, the heart muscle does not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients.
Ischemia and Tissue Damage: The lack of oxygen and nutrients leads to ischemia (insufficient blood supply) and subsequent damage or death of the heart muscle tissue.
Severity and Location of Blockage: The severity and location of the blockage determine the extent of the heart attack and its potential impact on overall heart function.
Prompt Medical Attention: Recognizing the symptoms of a heart attack and seeking immediate medical help is crucial to minimize damage and improve outcomes.
What are the symptoms of a heart attack?

Chest Discomfort: The most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain or discomfort. It may be described as a feeling of tightness, pressure, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest. Upper Body Pain: Pain or discomfort may also extend beyond the chest to other areas, such as the arms (usually the left arm, but can also affect the right arm), back, neck, jaw, or stomach. Shortness of Breath: Many people experience shortness of breath or have difficulty catching their breath during a heart attack. This can occur along with or without chest pain. Nausea and Sweating: Nausea, vomiting, and sweating are common symptoms that some individuals may experience during a heart attack. These symptoms can be accompanied by a sense of dizziness or lightheadedness. Fatigue and Weakness: Unexplained fatigue or weakness can be a symptom of a heart attack, particularly among women or older adults. Anxiety and Restlessness: Feelings of anxiety or restlessness can sometimes occur during a heart attack. Individuals may have a sense of impending doom. Silent Heart Attack: In some cases, a heart attack can be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms that are easily overlooked. These "silent" heart attacks can occur without noticeable chest pain but still cause damage to the heart.
